# todo-app
An App containing a to-do list of items. HTML, CSS and JavaScript are used to build the App.

My purpose for building this App is to demonstrate how JavaScript can be used to complete different tasks and how it can be combined with HTML and CSS to achieve that purpose. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
