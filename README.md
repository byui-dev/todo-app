# todo-app
An App containing a to do list of items

# Overview

The main app of working on this project was to enhance my skills 
in working with JavaScript, which is a widely used programming language that is used to build software by many developers and engineers.

# todo-app
An App containing a to-do list of items. HTML, CSS and JavaScript are used to build the App.

My purpose for building this App is to demonstrate how JavaScript can be used to complete different tasks and how it can be combined with HTML and CSS to achieve that purpose.
